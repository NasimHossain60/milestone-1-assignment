                    Heavy monsoon downpours in Bangladesh’s northeastern and northern regions have stranded hundreds of

                    Bangladesh floods - urgent appeal
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Bangladesh has been hit with the worst flooding in 100 years. Thousands of children are at risk,
                    threatened by a high risk of drowning, disease, and malnutrition. More than 36,000 children are
                    crowded into emergency flood shelters. Families and children are trapped at home waiting for boats
                    to bring relief. Roads and homes have been submerged, power stations are down, and over 380 schools
                    have been closed or impacted.

                <p>
                    About 26,000 sq km (18%) of Bangladesh is flooded by monsoons every year. At this time, especially
                    in the northern part of the country, the flood-affected people are the victims of extreme misery.
                    Every year, the As-Sunnah Foundation carries out relief activities in the flood-hit districts of the
                    country and takes the initiative to stand by the needy and helpless people.

                    Regular donations of the monthly donor members are a means of sustainable income for the
